// Notes

✅ 1. Classes and Objects

Class:
- A blueprint/template for creating objects.
- Defines variables (fields) and methods (functions).
Example:
    class Car {
        String color;
        void drive() {
            System.out.println("Car is driving");
        }
    }

Object:
- An instance of a class.
- Created using the `new` keyword.
Example:
    Car myCar = new Car();
    myCar.color = "Red";
    myCar.drive();


✅ 2. Static Keyword

Usage: Applied to variables, methods, blocks, or nested classes.

Static variable (class variable):
- Shared among all objects of the class.
    static int count = 0;

Static method:
- Belongs to the class, not objects. Can’t access non-static members directly.
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }

Static block:
- Runs once when the class is loaded.
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }


✅ 3. Final Keyword

Usage: Applied to variables, methods, and classes.

Final variable:
- Constant value, cannot be changed.
    final int MAX = 100;

Final method:
- Cannot be overridden in a subclass.
    final void display() {
        System.out.println("Can't override me");
    }

Final class:
- Cannot be extended.
    final class Animal {}
